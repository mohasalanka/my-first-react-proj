## Components
# TransactionTable
This component renders a table of all transactions. It receives an array of transactions as a prop.

# TransactionForm
This component renders a form to add a new transaction. When the form is submitted, the new transaction is added to the TransactionTable component's state.

# SearchBar
This component filters transactions by the search term. It receives a callback function that is triggered every time the user types in the search bar. The callback function updates the TransactionTable component's state to display only the transactions that match the search term.

# MyComponent
This component demonstrates the use of useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and lifecycle methods.

# Code Optimization
The code is optimized for performance using destructuring and spreading techniques to avoid unnecessary rendering and improve code readability.

# Testing
The code is thoroughly tested to ensure it meets all the requirements and works as intended. Tests were performed using Jest and React Testing Library.
